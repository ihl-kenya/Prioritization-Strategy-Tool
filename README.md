# Prioritization-Strategy-Tool
App for prioritizing Health Products and Technologies at county level


### Background
With the completion of the quantification process, advocacy for more commodities is an ongoing process, however, we are alive to the fact that resources are limited and many times the allocated resources fall way below what is the actual needs by the health facilities. Thus, there is need to prioritize what to procure with the limited resources that are available. 

The different players thus need to select health products and technologies that ensure that the right product that meets the needs of the customers is available at the service delivery point. There must be clear criteria for the prioritization of the right products based on their quality and effectiveness in treatment, disease burdens, and affordability. National essential medicines lists and essential service package plans contain medicines and non-drug consumables that are considered vital for programs. 

Decisions about product selection are made by different HPTUs as guided by the National Policies and are often contextualized. This process at the moment is not well documented and may not be informed by the needs of the facilities and oftentimes there are stockouts of life-saving commodities and sometimes an overstock of the non essential. 

inSupply Health proposed a process in which it can support the counties to better prioritize purchase of HPTs at the different levels. A co-creation workshop is conducted for the purpose of ensuring that a prioritization process is documented and a tool designed to guide the counties. A dummy prototype (tool)[https://scdatause.shinyapps.io/Prioritization-Strategy-Tool/] was used to trigger creative thinking with regard to the requirements and functionality of the tool. User requirements for the final tool were also documented. 

This repository aims to host the codebase for the final tool that will be rolled out for use in prioritization by the counties.
